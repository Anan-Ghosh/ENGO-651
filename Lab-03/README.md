Calgary Building Permits Map serves as an interactive website application that enables users to inspect and view building permits released in Calgary. Users can apply date parameters to permit data before viewing locations as interactive markers which display contractor names and community information and addresses by clicking markers. The site combines Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap with Calgary's Open Data API to achieve live mapping and data acquisition purposes. The system has marker clustering alongside overlapping marker handling features that create an easy-to-use experience for users.
